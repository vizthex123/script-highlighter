*Installation instructions: Unzip the file then import it into Notepad++ (Under Languages > User-Defined Languages > open User-Defined Language Folder, then just unzip it/move the .xml there) to use it. Click on the "Languages" tab, and it should be at the bottom of the list. Both versions can be installed at the same time (but be sure to use the correct one since the syntaxes are different).*

I made this because I found a [similar project](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/zenscript-syntax-highlighter-for-notepad) that seems to have stopped being maintained (and also didn't support the syntax changes from 1.14 & up)

It will highlight the various CraftTweaker methods in Notepad++, to make it easier to locate something (and spot errors). Examples are in the [images tab](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/zenscript-highlighter/screenshots).

<br />

I plan to add support for as many mods as I can (but mostly the ones I've used).

Most of the colouring got inspired by how C# and Java highlight things, while some of them are just me trying to copy the main colours of the mod.
